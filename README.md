<!-- Why Use OurTunes-->
## Why Use OurTunes

We created OurTunes to display our abilities to create and plan a wireframe with the input of multiple people, use multiple data tables, and build a n-tiered API.

OurTunes is intended to be an application that will allow an artist to upload their own songs, organize their own playlists, and listen to other artists' music.
