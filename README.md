# TwoWeekProject
Welcome to "OurTunes"!
OurTunes is a service where any user that registers can create and upload songs, manage playlits, and listen to other users' songs.
You can clone our project by pressing the "Clone or download" button, then tapping the clipboard to copy it.
Once you have copied the project, you can open your file explorer and type "cmd" into the folder you'd like the project placed.
Once you are in your terminal (it should be a black box with white text), type "git clone" and paste the project you copied.
Lastly, press "Enter" and the project will be cloned to your computer.
Next, you would want to open Postman. We will use Postman to test methods until we have a "front end" for our application's users.
After opening Postman, go back to the project in Visual Studio.
Press the green run button at the top. Once you run the application, your preferred internet browser will appear and display the API information.
Next to the application name will be a 3-lined drop down. Press the dropdown, then press "API". This takes us to every feature we have to use the API.
For a quick example of this, scroll down to "Song" and press "POST api/Song". Now, let's use Postman.
Open Postman and press the "+" under "My Workspace". Once you press the "+", change the dropdown to your left tp "POST".
After changing your mehtod to POST, paste the url from your API in your browser to the URL space in Postman. (ex. https://localhost:44364)
Now add to the end of the URL "api/Song". Doing this will give us the option to create a song.
